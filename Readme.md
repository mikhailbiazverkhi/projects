# About Me

I am a Software Engineer with more than 6 years of experience in development, automation, and system engineering.

My core stack is C# and .NET.
I also have strong experience in QA automation, Linux systems, API integration, and virtualization environments.

This repository describes selected engineering projects I have worked on.

# Selected Engineering Projects
1️⃣ Telecom Automation System (Linux / Asterisk / C)
- Problem

The company needed an automated way to decode DTMF audio signals received through phone calls.

- Architecture

Mobile phone → GSM modem (USB) → VirtualBox → CentOS Linux → Asterisk PBX → Custom C module → Decoder → SMS response

- What I Did

Configured GSM modem pipeline

Implemented USB passthrough to Linux virtual machine

Modified C source code to extract decoded digits into text file

Rebuilt Linux distribution to persist system-level modifications

Automated SMS response for verification

- Result

Fully automated telecommunication decoding system.
Director personally tested the system and confirmed successful end-to-end processing.

Technologies: Linux (CentOS), Asterisk PBX, C, VirtualBox, GSM modem

2️⃣ Camera Auto-Calibration System (C# / WPF)

Company: Retail Robotics Solutions

- Problem

Outdoor lighting conditions affected camera measurements and system accuracy.

- What I Built

Real-time camera integration in WPF application

Adaptive brightness and exposure calibration

RGB reference marker detection

Matrix-based mathematical calculation for weight estimation

- Result

Improved measurement stability under dynamic lighting conditions in production environment.

Technologies: C#, .NET Framework, WPF, imaging libraries

3️⃣ QA Automation Framework Enhancement (C#)

Using Ranorex Studio

- Problem

Failed automated tests did not provide enough information to quickly identify root causes.

- Solution

Integrated real-time screen recording during test execution

Connected Microsoft libraries into test project

Generated video files for failed scenarios

Proposed improvements for data sharing between test cases

- Impact

Significantly reduced debugging time.
Some proposed improvements were later reflected in product updates.

Technologies: C#, .NET, UI automation

4️⃣ Database → Salesforce Integration Tool
- Problem

Manual synchronization between internal MSSQL database and CRM system.

- Solution

Developed C# tool for automated data export

Integrated REST API communication with Salesforce

Implemented JSON serialization and validation logic

Automated status updates

- Result

Reliable enterprise data synchronization workflow.

Technologies: C#, REST API, MSSQL, JSON
