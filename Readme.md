## Telecom Automation System (Linux / Asterisk / C)
- Problem

Manual verification of DTMF-based authentication signals.

- Solution

Designed automated decoding pipeline using GSM modem + Asterisk PBX.

- Architecture

GSM → USB → VirtualBox → CentOS → Asterisk → C module → Decoder → SMS

- Result

Fully automated telecommunication processing system.

## QA Automation Enhancement (C# / Ranorex)
- Problem

Failed tests lacked clear diagnostics.

- Solution

Integrated runtime video recording for automated test sessions.

- Impact

Reduced debugging time and improved failure traceability.
